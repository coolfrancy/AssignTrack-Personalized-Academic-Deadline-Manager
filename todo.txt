#crazy idea-add a feature to connect to people with similar assighnments



#get somebody that knows css to adjust css - later

#--add hashing to users tokens when storing info

#make sure before adding number to database it verifies

#add a feature that also send if its less then a specific day time

#fix login option

add reminders to database with pythoon file

if a user already have a token i allow them to edit the token but if the user doesnt have a token i add it



#make sure when adding tokens they have a value
#check if password in logs

##can edit token even when cookie has expired-needs to be fixed

rem
#tmrw
 add the ability to send email notification


#im going to have a main file that runs the upcoming function and check the databases for reminders that need
to be reminded and maybe thats when i add to the last sent table


#temp
first i would go to the reminders tables iterating over that and
getting their norification


run the upcoming function and check the databases for reminders that need
to be reminded and maybe thats when i add to the last sent table

create a view thats basically the query to get all the information to run upcoming

Upcoming(school_url, token, days_ahead)

###
make it so email and phone number notification is automatically added into the notification 
proferences

maybe addd trigger for when adding a user it also adds preferences

#add the ability for the user to reset password after verification ofc


#make remind also send notification while it does its check
#give the users the ability to change their phone number

"""make sure days aheadisnt 0 so people dont get false and mess up the system"""
                                                                                           

#later
add a validation for number and email address
#make sure hashing is occuring for tokens and password

#think about when i should send users their notification, just got an idea of allowing user to decide when they should get the notification

#think about storing passwords in the database as a schema

#add the error for token and school like this Token: please make sure you have the correct school and token

#get someone whos good at css

#todo
do chores
